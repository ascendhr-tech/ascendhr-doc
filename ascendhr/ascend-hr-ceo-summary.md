## 🧮 Quick Budget Calculations

### Formula
```
Total Budget = Man-days × Rate per Day × Number of Developers
```

### Sample Scenarios (56 man-days with buffer)

| Rate/Day | × 56 days | Total Budget |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| ฿3,000 | 56 × ฿3,000 | ฿168,000 |
| ฿4,000 | 56 × ฿4,000 | ฿224,000 |
| ฿5,000 | 56 × ฿5,000 | ฿280,000 |
| ฿6,000 | 56 × ฿6,000 | ฿336,000 |
| ฿8,000 | 56 × ฿8,000 | ฿448,000 |

> **Note:** These are per-developer rates. Total team cost may vary based on individual rates.

### Conservative vs Buffered Estimate

| Scenario | Man-days | At ฿5,000/day |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Base (no buffer) | 46 days | ฿230,000 |
| With 20% buffer | 56 days | ฿280,000 |
