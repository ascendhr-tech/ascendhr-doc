## 🧮 Quick Budget Calculations

### Formula
```
Total Budget = Man-days × Rate per Day
```

### Sample Scenarios (71 man-days with buffer)

| Rate/Day | × 71 days | Total Budget |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| ฿3,000 | 71 × ฿3,000 | ฿213,000 |
| ฿4,000 | 71 × ฿4,000 | ฿284,000 |
| ฿5,000 | 71 × ฿5,000 | ฿355,000 |
| ฿6,000 | 71 × ฿6,000 | ฿426,000 |
| ฿8,000 | 71 × ฿8,000 | ฿568,000 |

> **Note:** These are total project costs (man-days), not per person.

### Conservative vs Buffered Estimate

| Scenario | Man-days | At ฿5,000/day |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Base (no buffer) | 58.5 days | ฿292,500 |
| With 20% buffer | 71 days | ฿355,000 |
